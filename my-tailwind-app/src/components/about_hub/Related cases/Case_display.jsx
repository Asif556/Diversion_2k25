        <li>Facts: The Berubari Union, a small region in West Bengal, was to be ceded to Pakistan as part of the Indo-Pakistan agreement in 1958. The issue raised concerns about whether a part of Indian territory could be ceded to another country without amending the Constitution.</li>
        <li>Ruling: The Supreme Court held that Parliament alone could not cede territory to a foreign country through an executive agreement. To alter the territory of India, a constitutional amendment under Article 368 is required. The court ruled that the transfer of the Berubari Union could only be completed by amending the Constitution.</li>
